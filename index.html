<h1>Tarkarli Tour</h1>
<p>nown for its white sandy beach and water sports, Tarkarli is situated in the Sindhudurg district of Maharashtra. Tarkarli beach is arguably one of the most picturesque beaches in the Konkan region of Maharashtra. The white sand, clear blue water and the suru (casurina) trees add to the splendor of the beach. The sea at Tarkarli is crystal clear and the seabed can be seen up to a depth of 15 ft or more on a sunny day.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Another attraction of Tarkarli is the backwaters of Karli river which extend from Tarkarli to Kudal. It is the only place to experience the backwaters in Maharashtra. The estuary of Karli river is another scenic spot located near Tarkarli.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Tarkarli is also the only place in Maharashtra where you can scuba dive. The waters are relatively clear around the Sindhudurg fort and though the reefs here aren’t exactly world class, it is not a bad idea to try it out once. Guides and instructors are helpful and patient; if you are keen, you can even enroll for a special certified course.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Tarkarli is situated close to several tourist attractions including the Sindhudurg fort (headquarters of Shivaji’s navy), Kolamb beach and Dharampur lake.</p>
